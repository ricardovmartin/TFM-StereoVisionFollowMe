Master thesis of Alberto Aguayo Garc√≠a entitled "Recognition of people for tracking using mobile robots"

During rescue work, effectiveness and quickness are critical, as the time elapsed until 
wounded are attended in this type of manoevre can help to decrease the state gravity of the 
patient. In this work, a human recognition system is developed for mobile robot tracking. The 
goal is to recognize a person and locate their distance and orientation from the robot so that 
the robot can follow him. The development seeks to improve the capabilities of current 
systems, whose limitations in rescue missions, identified during realistic exercises, are used 
as a starting point for the development of this work.
